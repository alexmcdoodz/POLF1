# POLF by Alex McDonald and Charlotte Stick

## Intro
Our game idea was to combine features from pool and mini golf, as we felt that neither game idea allowed us to fully demonstrate all the features needed for higher level marks. The concept is that the player has to hit all of the pool balls into the golf hole, using the cue ball to move them, in the least amount of strokes. If you hit the cue ball into the hole, it is a foul and you lose a life. 

## Task breakdown

### Create Ball class (Both)
### Create CueBall class, inherits from Ball (Charlotte)
### Create Boundary class (Both)
### Set world variables including gravity and friction (Charlotte)
### Create mouse input (Charlotte)
### Implement Ball.addForce() (Charlotte)
### Prevent balls from being picked up by the user (Alex)
### Implement pointer (Both)
### Implement circle-circle collision detection for hole (Alex)
### Create Level class (Alex)
### Create Game class (Alex)
### Add colours to objects to make the game more understandable while playing (Alex)
### Implement lives system to count fouls (Alex)
### Prevent the user from hitting the cue ball while it's moving (Alex)
### Create PowerUp class and system (Alex)
### Design second level (Alex)
### Implement sand pit for third level (Charlotte)
### Implement end score screen on completing level three and restart button (Alex)
### Write markdown documentation (Charlotte)

## Higher distinction level features

### Unique game concept
Our game idea is original and creative
### Probabilty based power up system
The power ups have a random spawn location, and the type of power up is also random
### Power up system has multiple power up types
The power up can be an extra life, high friction ("Lead ball"), or low friction ("Extra speed")
### Three levels with a variety of layouts and features
The first level has two pool balls and a power up, the second level has a pyramid of 6 pool balls and a power up, and the third level has two pool balls and a sand pit area

## Future plans
In our original idea, we wanted to put in the crazy golf concept of having weirdly shaped courses and silly obstacles ect. As we began coding the project we decied that this would be too complex for our timeframe, so we stuck to a simple rectangular course and a sand pit obstacle.
